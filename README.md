# CalendarAgent

The feature branches represent different basic architectures of the fundamental agent architecture.

- **Chaining**: This branch focuses on creating a sequence of operations where the output of one operation serves as the input for the next.
- **Routing**: This branch deals with directing tasks or messages to the appropriate agent or service based on predefined rules.
- **Parallelization**: This branch emphasizes executing multiple operations simultaneously to improve performance and efficiency.

Each branch explores a unique aspect of agent architecture, providing a comprehensive understanding of how agents can be structured and optimized.
